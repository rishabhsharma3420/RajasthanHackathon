# WC Sustainability


**Food waste** is a systemic problem. Proximately **35%-45%** of food in the country is never gets eaten, which is just a mind-boggling amount. It's estimated that if food waste were a country, it would be the **third largest emitter of carbon emissions** behind only the US and China.

Every year, the food we never eat cost **$3.18B** It's consuming **25% of our fresh water** to produce this food. There are over **190.7M** Indians that are food insecure. The reality is there is a disconnect, often, between the organisations that have surplus food and those that can do something with it. **Technology can play a role in connecting those that have and those that needed in a way that has not been done before**.

Our product is an **enterprise software** that helps big food business' manage unsold inventory. We do that by syncing in with companies' inventory system to give them insight into what they are selling and we provide real time communication to help large food business' connect with Non Profit Partners. Food that might otherwise have ended up in a dumpster can quickly be diverted to an organisation that can do something great with it.

When it comes to food waste, there is no single organisation, no single entity that you can point a finger at and say stop this and our ultimate goal is to help prevent food waste from happening in the first place. So for us it is communication via notifications, introducing real time responsiveness for these big distributors to get that product out. Supply and demand is incredibly hard to manage in the food industry, and this creates surplus. And, often times its fantastic product that is still edible and it just isn't making its way to customer.



## Our product

**WC Sustainability** is a website which bridges the gap between the big food giants like MC Donald's or Burger King where food is wasted in huge amounts and that food is put to a better use by **distributing the food to the poor and the needy people.** We make this noble cause possible by contacting various local NGO's near an outlet

**WC SUSTAINABILITY** acts as a bridge between the **NGO's** and the **Food Giants**
